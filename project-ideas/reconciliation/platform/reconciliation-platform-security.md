# Reconciliation Platform Security

## Goal

Protect client data end-to-end and prevent cross-client leakage while keeping the platform operable at scale.

## Core Principles

- Least privilege for services, users, and integrations
- Strong tenant isolation by default
- Encrypt data in transit and at rest
- Auditability for all access and changes

## Data Isolation

- Tenant-scoped storage with strict access controls
- Separate credentials per client integration
- Rule packages and outputs isolated per tenant

## Access Control

- Role-based access for operators and support staff
- Short-lived credentials for services
- Environment-level separation (dev, staging, prod)

## Data Protection

- TLS for all ingestion endpoints (SFTP, API, GraphQL)
- Encryption at rest for databases and file storage
- Secrets stored in a managed vault, never in code

## Audit and Monitoring

- Log all data access and rule changes
- Alert on unusual access patterns or data volumes
- Regular access reviews and key rotation

## Operational Practices

- Minimize PII in reconciliation datasets
- Mask or tokenize sensitive fields when possible
- Retention policies aligned to client agreements

## Next Steps

- Define the tenant model and access roles
- Choose the vault and logging stack
- Document security requirements for integrations
