# Reconciliation Platform

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of the Reconciliation Platform is to provide a systematic, scalable, and independent way to verify data consistency across systems. This platform ensures that expected data syncs are occurring correctly and highlights mismatches early, before they become operational issues.

## 2. Problem Statement

As the number of systems involved in commerce workflows grows (POS, OMS, WMS, ERP, etc.), it becomes increasingly difficult to validate that data is:

- Successfully synced
- Accurate across systems
- Consistent over time

Today, reconciliation is largely:

- Manual
- Reactive
- Incident-driven

This creates operational risk and slows down issue resolution.

## 3. Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals

- Provide visibility into data consistency between systems
- Detect missing, mismatched, or delayed records
- Enable teams to validate sync behavior confidently

### Secondary Goals

- Reduce manual investigations
- Decouple reconciliation workloads from core commerce systems
- Support future reconciliation use cases without re-architecture

## 4. Guiding Principles

- Standalone by design
  Reconciliation must not impact production commerce databases.

- Configurable and extensible
  Rules, systems, and data points should evolve without major rewrites.

- System-agnostic
  The platform should support multiple data sources and protocols.

- Operationally safe
  Heavy reads, comparisons, and transformations must occur outside core systems.

## 5. High-Level Architecture

### Standalone Service

- Runs independently of POS and OMS
- Maintains its own database
- Handles ingestion, comparison, and reporting

### Data Flow (Generic)

1. Collect data from source systems
2. Persist data in reconciliation DB
3. Execute reconciliation logic
4. Store and expose results

## 6. Data Ingestion Strategies

The platform should support multiple ingestion mechanisms:

### File-Based

- CSV files via SFTP
- Batch-friendly and operationally safe
- Suitable for large datasets and scheduled reconciliation

### API-Based

- REST APIs
- Useful for incremental or near-real-time reconciliation

### GraphQL

- Preferred where supported
- Enables selective data fetching

Each ingestion strategy should be pluggable and configurable.

## 7. Security Considerations

Security decisions must be standardized across integrations, including:

- Authentication strategy (shared JWT vs private credentials)
- Secure file access for SFTP
- Scoped access for APIs

These decisions will be finalized before production rollout.

## 8. Reconciliation Capabilities

The platform should eventually support:

- Presence checks (does a record exist?)
- Attribute-level comparisons
- Timestamp-based validations
- Cross-system consistency rules

Results should clearly indicate:

- Matches
- Missing records
- Out-of-sync records

## 9. Configurability and Extensibility

The platform should allow configuration of:

- Systems involved
- Data entities
- Comparison keys
- Execution frequency
- Reconciliation rules

This ensures long-term viability as business needs evolve.

## 10. Long-Term Vision

Over time, the platform can expand to:

- Additional workflows (shipments, returns, payments)
- Additional systems (WMS, ERP, finance tools)
- Automated alerts and dashboards
- Historical trend analysis

## 11. Success Criteria

The reconciliation platform is successful if it:

- Operates independently and safely
- Provides reliable, actionable reconciliation results
- Scales to additional systems and use cases
