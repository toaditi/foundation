# Standalone Reconciliation Platform - Service Overview

## Goal

Move reconciliation out of OMS into a standalone Moqui platform while keeping integrations stable and data isolated per client.

## Core Services and Purpose

- Ingestion Service: accept POS and OMS extracts (SFTP/API) and normalize into canonical records
- Reconciliation Service: run rules against canonical records and produce match, missing, and mismatch outcomes
- Reporting Service: assemble outputs (CSV or queryable views) and publish to configured destinations
- Integration Service: manage outbound deliveries (SFTP push, API callbacks) and status tracking
- Configuration Service: store tenant-specific rules, schedules, and mapping configurations
- Audit and Monitoring Service: record runs, rule versions used, and operational metrics

## Platform Boundaries

- No direct reads from OMS or POS databases
- All heavy computation occurs inside the platform database and services
- Tenant isolation enforced at storage and rule execution levels
